##Questions to ask : Can the # of given bishops be 0? Can the chess board be 0X0 1X1 where attacking is not possible at all? 
Will there be maximum value? Are tuples neccessary sorted? Do you mind a brute force algorithm?

##Solve:

M = (0, 0)
(1, 2)
(2, 2)
(4, 0)

checker=[[0 for x in range(M)] for x in range(M)]
